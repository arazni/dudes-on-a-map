# Things All Dudes and GMs Should Know

Abilities, skills, actions, etc. must make narrative sense. It doesn't have to be an ironclad justification, but if it doesn't make sense, then the **detail** goes away or the **action** can't be done.

Treat every rule and ability as if it has the clause *provided it makes sense in the narrative* attached to it.

Examples:

- Surfer has a suggested **action** that allows them to try to do something someone else just did. If that most recent **action** was a dragon breathing fire, a Surfer cannot do that. But! They may do something similar, if a lighter and some hairspray are on hand, for example.
- If you have an ability that lets you target multiple enemies, but your **action** or narration are in melee, you don't get to target someone across the room.

## Common Key Words

## Action

Outside of a **fight**, something you roll for.

During a **fight**, usually something you roll for, but also some things that take a bit of time or effort like moving or interacting with something.

## Chance x

A status toggle that increases or decreases your likelihood of getting good **results** on rolls. Each roll mechanic will explain how positive **chance** benefits them and **negative** chance harms them.

This should be relatively rare.

## Fight

The whole, you know, being in rounds of combat, taking turns, time slows down thing.

## Impact x

The amount you effect your target or challenge.

Typically, you can spend x **impact** to do any of the following

- Buff/debuff the target's **risk** by x through a **detail**
- Buff/debuff the target's **impact** by x through a **detail**
- Or, apply x **knocks** toward defeating the target or overcoming the challenge

## Knocks and Knocked Out (KO'd)

**Knocks** are points toward defeating a challenge or an enemy. **Dudes** and enemies have **KO** limits on their sheets. If they receive enough **knocks** to reach that limit, they're **KO'd** and are out of the **fight**.

**Dudes** who are **KO'd** must find some way to recover after a **fight** that involves some narrative effort and mechanical cost. This can be going to a hospital and paying for it, gaining a **detail** that effects them in some way, like *broke* reducing their **chance** to procure items or *seriously hurt* reducing their **risk** and **impact** by 1 until enough days pass for them to recover.

## Move

If you're playing on a grid of some kind, the amount of tiles you can move as an **action**. You cannot move as a **reaction**.

If you're not playing on a grid, consider it as a unit of measurement like a yard, a meter, or an abstract comparison of relative speed.

## Results

- **Ace**: You do the thing
- **Match**: You do the thing but you lose something or your opponent also does a thing to you
- **Countered**: You lose something or your opponent does a thing to you, which prevents you from doing the thing

In general, a **match** cannot reverse the thing you're doing or prevent it from happening. It's meant to make you deal with some separate consequence. You may get your **knocks** in, but the enemy gives you a *grabbed* **detail** that prevents you from moving and reduces your **risk**. You may have given them an *insulted* **detail** that reduces their **impact**, but they give themselves a *mad* **detail** that increases their **risk** against you for as long as they're insulted.

A **counter** might reverse what you were going for, turning your intention against yourself, or just be an enemy giving you some **knocks** or debuffing **details**, or even buffing **details** on themselves, for free.

## Reaction

An **action** you're invited to make when an opponent rolls a **match** or **countered** on an action targeting you. However, instead of **impact**, your **risk** powers this roll and is used in the exact same way.

Common **reactions** from **dudes** are **bets** and **resists**, and these are typically the only ones that involve rolls. Otherwise, you just spend **risk** on **knocks** and **details** as normal.

An enemy will typically not roll when using a **reaction**, simply dishing out their **risk** as **details** or **knocks**. But some will also have access to **bets** or **resists**.

Unlike **actions**, there are no limits to your number of **reactions** in a round. However, the GM should impose *bogus* to reduce your **risk** on a **reaction** if you use the same **reaction** multiple times in a round.

## Risk x

This is a measurement of how scary it is to mess with a target. This powers your **reactions** instead of **impact**. The higher the **risk**, the more consequences you'll deal with if you don't **ace** your roll.

## Roll

Every **dude** has asymmetric roll mechanics. Your **dude's** sheet will tell you how to roll and how to translate that roll to **results**.

You can draw on any of your **dude's** attributes or skills or whatever to roll, picking the one that makes the most sense for the narrative. If none make sense, your sheet will tell you what to roll.

## Common Action Terms

### Bet

A **bet** is a reaction a **dude** can use when being targeted by an enemy's **action** to raise the stakes. You cannot **bet** when being **aced** by your enemy.

You make a roll with the following results:

- **Ace**: Add your **impact** to your **risk**
- **Countered**: Add your **impact** to your opponent's **impact**
- **Match**: Both of the above

If the initiating **action** was **countered**, and you don't **ace** your **bet**, your enemy can deal you **knocks** or **details** equal to your **impact** instead. Basically, treat your opponent's **countered** like it had an **impact** of 0 before your **bet** powered it up and made it effective.

You then resolve the opponent's **impact** effects on you and your **risk** effects on your opponent normally.

### Resist

A roll a **dude** can use when being targeted by an enemy's **action** to reduce the resist the effects. Generally, the only way to reduce the impact of a roll on a **match** against you, which is otherwise discouraged.

You make a roll with the following results:

- **Ace**: Reduce the opponent's **impact** by your **risk**
- **Matched**: Reduce the opponent's **impact** by 1
- **Countered**: Increase the opponent's **impact** by 1
