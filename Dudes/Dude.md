# Dude

This dude is just a dude. A dude can always contribute, but it always costs something.

## Basics

Risk 2

Impact 2

Move: 5

KO: 6

## Rolls

You always **match**.

You convert **chance** into an **impact** buff or debuff. **Chance +x** becomes **amped x**, and **chance -x** becomes **bound x**.

## Suggested Fight Actions

Anything that makes sense for your character given how they're envisioned and their role in the party/plot. If you're a whole dang ass freak wizard who casts spells, that's great! Cast your spells. But if you're Bob from Accounting, Cindy the mechanic, etc., you should stick with things those folks are capable of doing (though definitely slowly push their limits more and more).

## Optional Subtypes

### A Kid

A kid is meant to be played by kids who are learning TTRPGs. Kids cannot be knocked or violently hurt in game, but have incoming buffs and debuffs doubled.

They can always choose to flip a coin if they don't want to **match**. If they call the coin flip correctly, they **ace**. Otherwise, they're **countered**.

[I want to help kids learn to engage with the **match** mechanic as a baseline and learn that consequences are part of what makes a game and story fun. Getting something and giving something can really push stories in interesting directions, but is a hard lesson to learn. It also allows them to engage with the "gamble" aspect at their own pace, and is a thing they have to opt into. The coin flip makes that risk very clear. Finally, children being hurt just kinda stinks, but a kid punching a bad guy and then being lifted up by the shirt and flailing until someone can help fits in with the spirit of the game rather well.]

### The Gambler

The gambler picks a favorite coin, die, or card.

Write down a lucky result (e.g. heads, hearts, aces, 6, 7, or 20) and an unlucky result (e.g. tails, spades, kings, 1, 13, or 20). The only requirements are that the lucky result has an equal chance of happening as the unlucky result, and that they do not overlap.

If you get your lucky result, you **ace**. If you get your unlucky result, you are **countered**. For all other results, you **match**.

Any time you would roll, you can choose either to stick with the basic dude's ability to always **match** or to roll as above.

[Even when you pick a character who specifically doesn't engage with any dice mechanics, sometimes you still want to do a little gambling.]
